\chapter{Problem Definition and Algorithms}

In this chapter we will formally define the query optimization problem in the
context of temporal relational databases.

\section{Problem definition}

In this section, we define the types of query we are to optimize.  We define the
cost model, and finally formulate the snapshot placement problem as an
optimization problem.
