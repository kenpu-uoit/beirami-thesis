We present several results on optimal snapshot materialization
for append-only temporal databases in order to support very large
scale query workload.  Our data model is temporal relational data
stored in an append-only database. When the temporal database receives
multiple queries querying at different timestamps along the timeline, it
would be prohibitively expensive to recompute the snapshots at each
of the timestamps.

In this paper, we present a practical solution to support large query load
by materializing $m$ snapshots at optimal timestamps.  We show that optimal
snapshot timestamps can be computed efficiently in {\em linear time}.
We further show that with varying query load, we can dynamically adjust
snapshots to adjust to the changin query load.
