This thesis deals with the development of a Blockchain-based framework which is built on top of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to investigate the authenticity of the stored records using immutable and verifiable evidences. To do this, we proposed a mechanism to document proof of work for executive transactions on the database system in an append-only temporal log table. The temporal log tables utilize Blockchain technology for two purposes: first, to grant immutability for the stored records and second, to enable trustworthiness verifiability for the records. The objective that this dissertation is trying to achieve is to design a database system that is as open and as scalable as possible and yet non of the users of the system, regardless of their level of access to the database could conceal their activities on a database. 
Although logging the transactions along with their proof of work is very useful because it creates a source of data provenance for the database system, but the fact that they require linear time to query the historical data of records, is seen as a challenging problem. To address this issue, optimally creation of multiple snapshots for the materialization is suggested to lower the time complexity of querying for the historical records on the log tables. The proposed system supports all RDBMS systems and to achieve its objectives, the system solely rely on verifiable evidences and not on putting trust on the users of the system.
