This thesis owes its existence to the help, support and inspiration of several people. Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to professor Ken Pu and professor Ying Zhu my advisors, for their supports, understanding, patience, enthusiasm and encouragement and for pushing me further than I thought I could go. I would also like to thank professor Jaroslaw Szlichta and professor Ming Dong for their assistance and suggestions to write this thesis.
I wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere and particular appreciation to my family for their unflagging love, tremendous support and unconditional encouragement throughout my life and my studies.
