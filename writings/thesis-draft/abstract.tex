 This thesis deals with the development of a framework based on Blockchain technology that is implemented on top of a Relational Database Management System and makes it extremely difficult for the privileged or unprivileged users of the system to conceal their activities on a relational database. We present a mechanism to audit the activities of the users, verify the validness of submitted transactions on the database and create a Blockchain out of submitted transactions. We also present a practical solution to handle large query workloads on the temporal audit tables. By implementing this framework, not only proof of work is available, but also malicious activities such as intentional or unintentional fake data manipulation could be discovered and reported to the moderator of the system.
