 This thesis deals with the development of a framework based on Blockchain technology that is implemented on top of a relational database and makes it extremely difficult for the privileged or unprivileged users of the system to conceal their activities on a relational database. To achieve this objective, a mechanism is presented to audit and record the activities of the users, and testify that the transactions are submitted from valid sources. Since the query performance in a relational database decay as the data grow in volume, a practical solution is also presented to handle large query workloads on the temporal audit tables. By implementing this framework, not only malicious activities such as intentional or unintentional fake data manipulation on the tables are discovered and reported, but also the proof of work for each record is available to provide transparency for all the records that are stored in the database.
