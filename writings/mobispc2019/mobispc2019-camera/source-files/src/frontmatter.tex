\begin{abstract}
    With the emergence of large scale data collection from Internet of Things
    and mobile devices, the notion of trust is now an increasingly
    important aspect of the next generation of data processing
    systems. We propose a blockchain enabled relational storage system that
    supports immutable transactions and temporal snapshots.  By embedding
    blockchains in relational tables, the database stores trust related
    information in a tamper proof fashion, making the data provenance provably
    verifiable.
    To support large query workloads, we further propose an optimization
    algorithm that determines the best temporal snapshots to materialize in
    order to minimize the total
    time cost of answering a given query workload. Experimental evaluation
    shows that our materialized snapshot approach improves the performance of
    large analytical query workloads by as much as 50 times.
