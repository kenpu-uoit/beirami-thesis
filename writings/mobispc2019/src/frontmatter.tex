\begin{abstract}
    With the emergence of large scale data collection from Internet of Things
    and mobile computing devices, the notion of trust is becoming an increasing
    important aspects of the next generation of high performant data processing
    systems. We propose a blockchain enabled relational data storage system that
    supports immutable transactions and temporal snapshots.  
    To support large query workloads, we further proposed an optimization
    algorithm that determines the best temporal snapshots to minimize the total
    time cost of answering the given query workload.
