\section{Related Work}

Trustworthiness has received attention in recent years in various areas
such as real-time distributed systems \cite{khayat2017trust}, secret
sharing schemes in the cloud \cite{dutta2013privacy}, and utilizing log files
for forensic analysis \cite{sinha2014continuous}.  

Our work focuses on trusted
transactions in an environment where users cannot be trusted, not even users
with root access to the underlying database. The scenario of privileged
malicious users has been discussed by several researchers
\cite{crosby2009tamper-evident,wagner2018detect,wanger2017carving}. The approach
used were network based and data inspection based detection mechanisms for
database tampering.  Our approach, relying on an embedded blockchain, does not
require deep access to the system level signals (such as filesystem activity or
network traffic inspection).

There have also been work on database level forensic inspection
\cite{fabbri2013select,hauger2014information} using trigger and related database
features.  When running at scale, triggers can be prohibitively expensive.  Our
proposed approach uses much cheaper adhoc inspection of the blockchain structure
to determine the integrity of the database.

Query answering using materialized views is a well established field in database
\cite{du2017deepsea,sohrabi2016materialized,shukla1998materialized,aouiche2006clustering}.
They have been focused on views that are defined by general SQL queries.  In our
work, the snapshots are generated by a very specific form of query, and thus, we
are able to specialize the materialize view selection problem to obtain much
more efficient and optimal solution.
