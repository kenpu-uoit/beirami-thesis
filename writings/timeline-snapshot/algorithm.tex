\section{Algorithm}

We first solve the simpler single snapshot placement problem.

\begin{theorem}
    The single snapshot placement problem can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(|T_q|)$,
    with the optimal snapshot placement at
    $ s^*(T_q) = \mathrm{median}(T_q) $,
    which can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(|T_q|)$.
\end{theorem}
